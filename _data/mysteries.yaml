joyful:
  - name: Annunciation
    fruit: Humility
    reflection: |
      It is appropriate to begin the rosary with the virtue of humility. The
      _Catechism of the Catholic Church_ states that “humility is the foundation
      of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that ‘we do not know how to
      pray as we ought,’ are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. ‘Man
      is a beggar before God.’ “ (CCC 2559)
  - name: Visitation
    fruit: Love of Neighbor
    reflection: |
      Mary hastened to her cousin’s Elizabeth’s house to help her in her time of
      need. In what ways can we be of service to our own neighbor’s today,
      whether we find that neighbor in our own home, in our community, at work,
      or on the internet?
  - name: Nativity of the Lord
    fruit: Poverty of Spirit, Detachment from the Things of the World
    reflection: |
      We live in a very consumerist culture. This mystery invites us to detach
      ourselves from our many possessions. What do we truly need and what is
      excess? What can we share with others?
  - name: Presentation
    fruit: Obedience
    reflection: |
      Mary and Joseph humbly brought Jesus to the temple in accord with Jewish
      law. Obedience to God and to others can be very difficult, but offers us
      the opportunity to subjugate our own will to that of our heavenly Father.
      Not my will, but God’s will be done.
  - name: Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple
    fruit: Piety
    reflection: |
      Piety is dedication to the Church’s sacramental life and devotions. Mary
      and Joseph were surprised to find Jesus in the temple. We, too, should be
      dedicated to our Church and the sacraments.

luminous:
  - name: Baptism of Jesus
    fruit: Openness to the Holy Spirit
    reflection: |
      We each receive the Holy Spirit in a special way in Baptism and again at
      Confirmation. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding,
      counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. We need only
      ask the Holy Spirit for help and help will be provided.
  - name: Miracle at Cana
    fruit: To Jesus through Mary
    reflection: |
      Mary encouraged her Son to perform his first miracle at the Wedding at
      Cana. She simply told the servants to “do whatever he tells you.” She
      helps us in a similar way — always pointing us to her Son and interceding
      on our behalf. We need only to turn to her and ask for help.
  - name: Proclamation of the Kingdom of God
    fruit: Repentance, Trust in God
    reflection: |
      Jesus spent the active years of his ministry preaching and performing
      miracles to proclaim the Kingdom of God. He asks us to express sorrow from
      our sin, turn away from sin, and trust in God.
  - name: Transfiguration
    fruit: Desire for Holiness
    reflection: |
      Jesus gave three of his closest friends a glimpse of His glory at the
      Transfiguration. We, too, are called to holiness, and to ultimately live
      in glory in heaven. But, we need to want it and we need to want it more
      than what the world and the devil attempts to offer us.
  - name: Institution of the Eucharist
    fruit: Eucharistic Adoration, Active Participation at Mass
    reflection: |
      Jesus gave us the greatest gift in the Eucharist. He gave us His very
      self. This mystery invites us to appreciate that gift fully and to
      participate at Mass often

sorrowful:
  - name: Agony in the Garden
    fruit: Contrition, Conformity to the Will of God
    reflection: |
      Jesus, both fully human and fully divine, suffered immensely in the
      garden.  He knew what was coming and he was terrified.  He begged His
      Father to spare him, but submitted Himself fully to His will.  We, too,
      are called to do this.
  - name: Scourging at the Pillar
    fruit: Purity, Mortification
    reflection: |
      Mortification isn’t popular these days, but making small sacrifices and
      offering them up can be a great help to one’s spiritual life.  There is an
      opportunity every day to sacrifice and to suffer in some small way.
  - name: Crowning with Thorns
    fruit: Moral Courage
    reflection: |
      Jesus remained resolute even as he was being made fun of.  Do we have the
      courage to stand up for our convictions even when we are being laughed at?
      Whose opinion matters more – God’s or those who surround us?
  - name: Carrying of the Cross
    fruit: Patience
    reflection: |
      Patience is something we all seem to have difficulty with. Jesus patiently
      carried his cross through the streets of Jerusalem on the way to his
      Crucifixion.  We can look to him for help when we are tempted to lose our
      patience.
  - name: Crucifixion
    fruit: Salvation, Self-Denial
    reflection: |
      Jesus gave up everything for us on the cross.  His took on the sins of the
      world, past, present, and future, and died for our salvation.  We need to
      be so thankful for that gift.  At the same time, when we are asked to die
      to ourselves and put others first, we can look to the cross for the
      example of total self-giving.

glorious:
  - name: Resurrection
    fruit: Faith
    reflection: |
      It takes great faith to believe that Jesus rose from the dead and that we,
      too, shall rise.  As Jesus told his apostles, “Blessed are that who have
      not seen, and yet believe.” This mystery offers us help in maintaining
      that faith.  “Lord, I believe.  Please help my unbelief!”
  - name: Ascension
    fruit: Hope, Desire for Heaven
    reflection: |
      We hope for a world that is better than this one.  We desire to live
      forever with Jesus in heaven.  May that hope help shape our lives here on
      Earth.
  - name: Descent of the Holy Spirit
    fruit: Wisdom, Love of God
    reflection: |
      The disciples were scared.  They huddled together in that upper room not
      sure of what to do.  Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon them and they
      were ready to go out and give their very lives in service to God.  May the
      Holy Spirit also grant us that wisdom and love of God.
  - name: Assumption of Mary
    fruit: Devotion to Mary
    reflection: |
      Mary was brought up to heaven body and soul.  We are devoted to her
      because of her relationship to her Son and because God saw fit to raise
      her up.  “Blessed are you among women and Blessed is the fruit of your
      womb, Jesus.”
  - name: Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary
    fruit: Eternal Happiness
    reflection: |
      Mary is the Queen of Heaven, enjoying forever her rightful place next to
      her Son.  May we one day share in her happiness.
